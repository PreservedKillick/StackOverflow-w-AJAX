*****************
Lesson

Let's make a clone of Stack Overflow.

*As a user, I want to ask a question, so that I can get help with a programming problem I'm having. Users must have an account and sign in to ask questions.

_incomplete_

*As a user, I want to answer a question, so that I can help somebody else out. Use AJAX to add a response to the question's page without reloading it!

*As a user, I want to view a questions and its responses, so that I can get help if I'm having the same problem.
